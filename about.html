<p>I am a software engineer with a passion for big data.<p>
<p>This blog was started in October 2016 as part of my data science learning journey at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive">General Assembly London</a>.</p>
<p>    
I have explained in one of my first posts how much I admire Andrew Ng's teaching style and in particular his habit to always describe what he calls the <i>intuition</i> before going further into details. By intuition he means the core idea, the extreme simplification of a concept of phenomena that once undestood makes the rest of the learning process much simpler.
<p>My main motivation for this blog is to help anyone interested in data science grasp some of the core concepts by explaining the intuition behind these concepts.  I will focus on topics that I found challenging to understand during my own learning journey.
