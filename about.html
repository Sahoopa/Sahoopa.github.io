<p>I am a mathematician and data science enthusiast. I have loved playing with numbers since my childhood<p>
<p>This blog was started in October 2016 as part of my data science learning journey using open source technologies like Python at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive">General Assembly London</a>.</p>
<p>    
My previous analytics experience has taught me a lot but recently I have started participating in Kaggle competition. It made me realise that open source technologies are going to change the way analytics industry has been functioning. Hence I decided to learn open source and would be writing about my experiences.
<p>My intension behind this blog is to have some pointers for anyone who is aspiring to be data scientist and would be happy even if it helps to make aspiring data scientist journey a bit easier and fun.
